# Lab 01: Infrastructure Audit
**Name:** Nada Alaiban
**Date:** 1-26-2026
**Status:** Completed

## 🎯 Objective
To document the 2021 Facebook outage and practice using GitHub for enterprise documentation.

## 🔍 Key Findings (Case Study)
1.  **The Event:** On October 4, 2021, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger went down globally for nearly six hours, leaving billions of users without access.
2.  **The Technical Cause:** A configuration change to Facebook’s backbone routers caused a cascading failure, effectively removing routing paths for all Facebook services. This involved the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and affected DNS resolution, making it impossible to reach Facebook servers.
3.  **The Impact:** Users could not access Facebook or any associated services. Internal systems were also affected, so employees were locked out of offices and communications platforms. The outage took hours to resolve because Facebook’s systems are centralized and internal tools were also inaccessible.
